**Stardew.ModBuildConfig** is an open-source NuGet package which automates the build configuration
for [Stardew Valley](http://stardewvalley.net/) [SMAPI](https://github.com/Pathoschild/SMAPI) mods.

The package...

* lets you write your mod once, and compile it on any computer. It detects the current platform
  (Linux, Mac, or Windows) and game install path, and injects the right references automatically.
* configures Visual Studio so you can debug into the mod code when the game is running (_Windows
  only_).
* packages the mod automatically into the game's mod folder when you build the code (_optional_).

## Install
**When creating a new mod:**

1. Create an empty library project.
2. Reference the [`Pathoschild.Stardew.ModBuildConfig` NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Pathoschild.Stardew.ModBuildConfig).
3. [Write your code](http://canimod.com/guides/creating-a-smapi-mod).
4. Compile on any platform.

**When migrating an existing mod:**

1. Remove any project references to `Microsoft.Xna.*`, `MonoGame`, Stardew Valley,
   `StardewModdingAPI`, and `xTile`.
2. Reference the [`Pathoschild.Stardew.ModBuildConfig` NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Pathoschild.Stardew.ModBuildConfig).
3. Compile on any platform.

## Simplify mod development
### Package your mod into the game directory automatically
During development, it's helpful to have the mod files packaged into your `Mods` directory automatically each time you build. To do that:

1. Edit your mod's `.csproj` file.
2. Add this block of code at the bottom, right above the closing `</Project>` tag:

   ```xml
   <Target Name="AfterBuild">
      <PropertyGroup>
         <ModPath>$(GamePath)\Mods\$(TargetName)</ModPath>
      </PropertyGroup>
      <Copy SourceFiles="$(TargetDir)\$(TargetName).dll" DestinationFolder="$(ModPath)" />
      <Copy SourceFiles="$(TargetDir)\$(TargetName).pdb" DestinationFolder="$(ModPath)" Condition="Exists('$(TargetDir)\$(TargetName).pdb')" />
      <Copy SourceFiles="$(TargetDir)\$(TargetName).dll.mdb" DestinationFolder="$(ModPath)" Condition="Exists('$(TargetDir)\$(TargetName).dll.mdb')" />
      <Copy SourceFiles="$(ProjectDir)manifest.json" DestinationFolder="$(ModPath)" />
   </Target>
   ```
3. Optionally, edit the `<ModPath>` value to change the name, or add any additional files your mod needs.

That's it! Each time you build, the files in `<game path>\Mods\<mod name>` will be updated.

### Debug into the mod code (Windows Only)
Stepping into your mod code when the game is running is straightforward, since this package injects the configuration automatically. To do it:

1. [Package your mod into the game directory automatically](#package-your-mod-into-the-game-directory-automatically).
2. Launch the project with debugging in Visual Studio or MonoDevelop.

This will deploy your mod files into the game directory, launch SMAPI, and attach a debugger automatically. Now you can step through your code, set breakpoints, etc.

## Troubleshoot
### "Failed to find the game install path"
That error means the package couldn't figure out where the game is installed. You need to specify
the game location yourself. There's two ways to do that:

* **Option 1: set the path in the project file.**  
  _(You'll need to do it for every project that uses the package.)_
  1. Get the folder path containing the Stardew Valley `.exe` file.
  2. Add this to your `.csproj` file under the `<Project` line:

     ```xml
     <PropertyGroup>
       <GamePath>PATH_HERE</GamePath>
     </PropertyGroup>
     ```

  3. Replace `PATH_HERE` with your custom game install path.

* **Option 2: set the path globally.**  
  _This will apply to every project that uses version 1.5+ of package._

  1. Get the full folder path containing the Stardew Valley executable.
  2. Create this file path:
  
     platform  | path
     --------- | ----
     Linux/Mac | `~/stardewvalley.targets`
     Windows   | `%USERPROFILE%\stardewvalley.targets`

  3. Save the file with this content:

     ```xml
     <Project xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/developer/msbuild/2003">
        <PropertyGroup>
          <GamePath>PATH_HERE</GamePath>
        </PropertyGroup>
     </Project>
     ```

  4. Replace `PATH_HERE` with your custom game install path.

The configuration will check your custom path first, then fall back to the default paths (so it'll
still compile on a different computer).

## Versions
1.5 (upcoming):
* Added support for setting a custom game path globally.
* Added default GOG path on Mac.

1.4:
* Fixed detection of non-default game paths on 32-bit Windows.
* Removed support for SilVerPLuM (discontinued).
* Removed support for overriding the target platform (no longer needed since SMAPI crossplatforms mods automatically).

1.3:
* Added support for non-default game paths on Windows.

1.2:
* Exclude game binaries from mod build output.

1.1:
* Added support for overriding the target platform.

1.0:
* Initial release.
* Added support for detecting the game path automatically.
* Added support for injecting XNA/MonoGame references automatically based on the OS.
* Added support for mod builders like SilVerPLuM.
